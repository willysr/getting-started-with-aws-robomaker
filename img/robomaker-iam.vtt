00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.520
Now that we have the S3 bucket, we need to
create a IAM role and ensure permissions are

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.210
available to the key services.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:13.129
Search for IAM in the services search box.

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.659
Then click on Roles and "Create Role".

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:21.760
Select RoboMaker, and RoboMaker - Simulation
to have a role for running simulations.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.769
Next we need to specify the specific permissions.

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.029
First, we add EC2 Full Access.

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.670
Second the S3FullAccess.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.840
Third, CloudWatchLogsFullAccess.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.520
Note that if there were additional services
used, such as Kinesis or Rekognition, other

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.610
permissions should be added.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.290
Adding tags is optional.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.460
Finally, choose a role name and click on "create
role".
