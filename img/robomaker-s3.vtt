search box, S3.

We will create a new S3 bucket which will
contain our robotic application.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.541
The name of the bucket can be anything, here
test-robomaker is used.

00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:29.050
The other configurations can be left as default
for our purpose.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.110
