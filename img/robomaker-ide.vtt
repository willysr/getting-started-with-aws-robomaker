00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.580
Now we are ready to start the cloud development
environment.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.680
Search in all services, RoboMaker.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.639
Click on "Development Environment" and "Create
Environment".

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.299
The name is arbitrary.

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:16.290
In the example it is called RoboMaker-HelloWorld.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.621
The Pre-installed ROS distribution can be
ROS melodic.

00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:26.820
The instance type specifies the hardware of
the host computer used for RoboMaker.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.480
The default is ok.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.090
Once done, the IDE will start.
