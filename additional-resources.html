<meta name="description" content="How do robots work? What problems do they need to solve? How are they controlled?  The first course will dive into these questions, introducing you to the basics of robotics, with an overview on the robots’ components, modeling, and main problems to solve to achieve a fully autonomous system.  The main goal is to provide you the main insights to understand the robotics hardware and software available and get you comfortable in working with a robotics system capable of executing tasks in a real environment.  To reinforce your learning, short quizzes and exercises will be available at the end of each module, including analyzing existing robotic systems.  Robotics is still an open research area and many researchers around the world are contributing to its progress. Additional resources are included to further explore and deepen the topics covered in this course.">

        <p>Thank you for completing this introductory course on AWS RoboMaker and setting up the environment!</p>

<p>Resources are listed below to continue your learning journey.</p>

<h2 id="next-courses">Next courses</h2>
<p>Now that we have a brief overview of the AWS RoboMaker and a simulator set up for robotics software development in the cloud, the next step for developing and testing robotics systems is to learn the Robot Operating System (ROS). The immediate next course as part of this curriculum is Course 2: ROS fundamentals, which will allow you to become familiar with ROS.</p>
